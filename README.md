# Flight Disruption Analysis with Tableau

# About
Welcome to the "Flight Disruption Analysis" project on GitHub! This project is a dynamic exploration of flight delays and cancellations using powerful data visualization tools provided by Tableau. Delve into the intricacies of air travel disruptions through interactive visualizations, uncovering patterns, and gaining valuable insights into the factors influencing flight punctuality. By leveraging extensive datasets, this project sheds light on the challenges faced by both travelers and the aviation industry. Whether you're a data enthusiast, a frequent flyer, or an industry professional, this repository offers an engaging visual journey into the complexities of flight operations. Explore the visualizations, discover key trends, and enhance your understanding of the dynamics surrounding flight delays and cancellations.

# Benefits and Outcomes

• Identify Trends: Visualizations offer a clear representation of trends in flight delays and cancellations, enabling users to identify recurring patterns over time.

• Understand Causes: Explore the underlying factors contributing to disruptions, helping stakeholders understand and address root causes for improved operational efficiency.

• Optimize Planning: Airlines and airports can use insights to optimize flight schedules, reducing the impact of delays and enhancing overall travel planning.

• Enhance Passenger Experience: Travelers can make informed decisions by understanding peak disruption times, enabling them to plan their journeys more effectively.

• Improve Resource Allocation: Airlines can allocate resources more efficiently by analyzing when and where disruptions are most likely to occur, minimizing the impact on their operations.

• Inform Policy Decisions: Aviation authorities and policymakers can use visualizations to inform decisions regarding regulations and policies aimed at improving overall flight punctuality.

• Benchmark Performance: Airlines can benchmark their performance against industry standards, fostering healthy competition and encouraging continuous improvement in on-time performance.

# Data Dictionary 

• FL_DATE:	Flight Date (yyyymmdd)

• AIRLINE_CODE: Unique Carrier Code. When the same code has been used by multiple carriers, a numeric suffix is used for earlier users, for example, PA, PA(1), PA(2).

• DOT_CODE: An identification number assigned by US DOT to identify a unique airline (carrier). A unique airline (carrier) is defined as one holding and reporting under the same DOT certificate regardless of its Code, Name, or holding company/corporation.
